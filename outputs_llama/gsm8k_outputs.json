She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?\n<|assistant|>\nLet's first find out how many eggs Janet has left after eating 3 for breakfast and baking 4 for muffins.\n\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. Then, she bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.\n\nJanet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market. She sells each egg for $2, so she makes:\n\n9 eggs/day \u00d7 $2/egg = $18/day\n\nJanet makes $18",

How much profit did he make?\n<|assistant|>\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\n1. Josh buys a house for $80,000.\n2. He puts in $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n3. The value of the house increases by 150%, which means it becomes 150% of its original value. To find the new value, multiply the original value by 1.5:\n\n$80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000\n\nSo the new value of the house is $120,000.\n4. Since Josh sold the house",

How many total meters does he run a week?\n<|assistant|>\nJames runs 3 sprints 3 times a week.  Each sprint is 60 meters.  So the total meters he runs each time he runs 3 sprints is 3 x 60 = 180 meters.  He runs 3 times a week, so the total meters he runs a week is 3 x 180 = 540 meters.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 540. I hope it is correct.",

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?\n<|assistant|>\nWendi's chickens need 3 cups of feed each, and there are 20 chickens. So they need 20 x 3 = 60 cups of feed in total. In the morning, she gave them 15 cups. In the afternoon, she gave them 25 cups. So they need 60 - (15 + 25) = 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal. The answer is 20.",
