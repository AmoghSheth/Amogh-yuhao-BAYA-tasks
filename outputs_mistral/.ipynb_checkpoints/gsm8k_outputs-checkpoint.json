She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?\n<|assistant|>\nFirst, let's find out how many eggs Janet has left after eating for breakfast and baking muffins. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, she uses 7 eggs daily.\n\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. So, she has 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 eggs left to sell each day.\n\nShe sells each egg for $2. So, her daily earnings at the farmers' market are 9 eggs * $2/egg = $",

How much profit did he make?\n<|assistant|>\nFirst, let's find out the new value of the house after the repairs. We know that the repairs increased the value by 150% of the initial cost. So,\n\nNew value = Initial cost + (Initial cost * 150%)\n\nNew value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)\n\nNew value = $80,000 + $120,000\n\nNew value = $200,000\n\nNow, to find the profit, we subtract the",

How many total meters does he run a week?\n<|assistant|>\nJames runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters long. So, the total distance he runs in one day is 3 sprints * 60 meters = 180 meters. Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is 180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters.",
